# raise_poll

Application Name:--  
- WhatsApp 
 
Use case(s):--  
-	User should be able to raise poll/cast their vote in group chat.
 
Scenario(s):-- 
-	Let suppose in a Group chat, we want to decide/conclude something, so we just raise a poll/voting,
  set some options and when all members voted, finally, we can see which option get how much response. 

-	For example: There is a family members group, we want to decide a place for family-trip, whether we should go to Hyderabad or Bengaluru. 
               so we just raise a poll and set the options (it makes our task easy to decide the place otherwise it is very difficult to see
               each and every member's response manually in the group chat).

Bare Minimum Inputs:--
-	Poll Message
-	Options
-	Number of total voters/members

Output:--
-	Finally, we will know what the majority wants.
