# raise_poll
 
Usercase:- User should be able to raise poll/vote in group chat.

Scenario:- There is a family members group, we want to decide a place for family-trip, whether we should go to Hyderabad or Bengaluru. 
           so we just raise a poll and set the options (it makes our task easy to decide the place otherwise it is very difficult to see
           each and every member's response manually).
